# Customized PHP Docker Environment

This is a PHP environment for development purposes, and contains most of the
bells and whistles you're going to want to have when developing any of your
PHP applications and frameworks.

Note that this environment is probably not for everybody, as it contains a
bunch of things that most people would consider to be extraneous. In future
versions of this package, there will be environment flags that you can set
in order to turn on or off various things, but that's not where we are now.

# Settings and Options

Nothing here yet. It'll show up at some point, but I'm not making any promises
as to when that will be or what those options will be. This is still very much
just a when-I-need-it kind of development package.

# Copyright & License

This Docker container is free to use for whatever you want, without reference,
attribution or anything else. After all, none of its parts were actually made
by me, I just wrote the code that links it all together.

By using this Docker container for any reason, whether production or development,
you accept the term that I can not be held responsible for anything breaking in 
your own environment based on any changes or updates that I make to the container.
As it is based on my own needs in my own projects, it is subject to change - often
on very short notice. For that reason, please try avoiding it in your production
environments, but feel free to play around with it or try it out as inspiration
for your own PHP base container.
